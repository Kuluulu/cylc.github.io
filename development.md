# Development

Cylc development is managed at the [Cylc Organisation on
GitHub](https://github.com/cylc)

As of March 2020:
- The complete Cylc 7 project (Python 2) is maintained on the 7.8.x and 7.9.x
  branches of the cylc/cylc-flow repository.
- Cylc 8 (Python 3, not yet production ready) is being worked on in the
  following repositories:
  - cylc/cylc-flow (master branch)
  - cylc/cylc-ui (the new web UI)
  - cylc/cylc-uiserver (a new component to take data from scheduler programs and
    the filesystem, on the back end, and serve the web UI)
  - cylc/cylc-doc (documentation)
  - (and some smaller satellite repositories)
