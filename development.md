# Development

Cylc development is managed at the [Cylc Organisation on
GitHub](https://github.com/cylc)

Since mid-2020:

- The Cylc 7 project (Python 2) is maintained on the 7.8.x and 7.9.x
  branches of the cylc/cylc-flow repository.

- Cylc 8 (Python 3, web tech, new scheduling algorithm) is under development in
  multiple repositories:
  - cylc/cylc-flow (scheduler)
  - cylc/cylc-ui (web UI)
  - cylc/cylc-uiserver (interacts with schedulers, serves the UI)
  - cylc/cylc-doc (documentation)
  - (and several smaller projects)
