NOTE: the cylc repository side-bar information (latest release, recent
releases,...) will not be regenerated unless the source files change, which
they don't because we extract the latest release info automatically. To force
this, make some dummy change (e.g. whitespace) to _includes/repository.html.

ALSO: create the new "next-release" milestone and assign at least one issue to
it, to get the site release progress bar to work properly (else "NaN%" appears).
